# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a friend matching app based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. Each question has a response
of 1 through 5, 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. When the user submits the survey an existing record
is found and returned. As well as the closest user responses are defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for 
all ten questions combined. In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
