# FriendFinder

## Description

FriendFinder is a friend matching app based on the user's responses to a ten question survey. Each question has a response
of 1 through 5, 1 meaning strongly disagree and 5 meaning strongly agree. When the user submits the survey an existing record
is found and returned. As well as the closest user responses are defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for 
all ten questions combined.
